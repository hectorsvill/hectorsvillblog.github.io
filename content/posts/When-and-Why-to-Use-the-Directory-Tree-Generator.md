Imagine you're working on a large software project that's been in development for months. The codebase has grown significantly, with numerous directories and hundreds of files spread across the project. You're tasked with documenting the project's structure to help onboard new developers. Manually mapping out the entire directory tree would be time-consuming and error-prone. Enter the **Directory-Tree-Generator**, a simple yet powerful tool that can save you hours of work.

## What is the Directory-Tree-Generator?

The Directory-Tree-Generator is a Go program that quickly generates a directory tree of your project, either in text or JSON format. With just a few commands, you can visualize the structure of any directory, making it easier to document, review, or share with your team.

## Scenarios Where the Directory-Tree-Generator Shines

1. **Onboarding New Team Members**: When bringing new developers onto a project, a visual representation of the codebase's structure can make a big difference. Instead of explaining the project structure verbally or through outdated diagrams, you can use this tool to generate an up-to-date directory tree and share it with the team.

2. **Project Documentation**: Whether you're writing technical documentation or a project report, including a directory tree is a great way to give an overview of the project's layout. With the Directory-Tree-Generator, you can create a detailed directory tree in seconds, ready to be included in your documentation.

3. **Code Reviews**: During code reviews, it’s crucial to understand how new files and directories fit into the existing structure. By generating a directory tree before and after changes, reviewers can quickly compare the structures and spot any inconsistencies or unnecessary complexity.

4. **Archiving and Backup**: Before archiving or backing up a project, it's useful to have a clear record of its directory structure. This tool allows you to create a snapshot of the directory tree, ensuring that you know exactly what was included in the archive.

## How to Use the Directory-Tree-Generator

Using the Directory-Tree-Generator is straightforward, with several options to customize the output. Here’s a quick guide to get you started:

### Generating a Simple Directory Tree

To create a directory tree of the current directory in text format, simply run:

```bash
./dir_tree
```

This generates a `dir_tree.txt` file containing the structure. Here’s an example of what the output might look like:

```
.
├── main.go
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── utils.go
    └── handlers
        ├── auth.go
        └── data.go
```

### Customizing the Output Format

If you need the directory tree in JSON format, use the `-f` option:

```bash
./dir_tree -f json
```

This command creates a `dir_tree.json` file, which can be easily parsed or integrated into other systems.

### Specifying a Starting Directory

You can also generate a directory tree for a specific path. For example, to generate a tree for the `/home/user/documents` directory:

```bash
./dir_tree -d /home/user/documents
```

### Printing to the Console

If you prefer to see the directory tree directly in the console instead of writing it to a file, use the `-p` option:

```bash
./dir_tree -p
```

This command will display the tree in the terminal, which is useful for quick inspections or demonstrations.
