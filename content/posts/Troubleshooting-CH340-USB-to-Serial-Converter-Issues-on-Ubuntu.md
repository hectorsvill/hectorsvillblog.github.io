The CH340 USB-to-serial converter, widely used in Arduino-compatible boards and other electronic devices, is known for its reliability and affordability. However, Ubuntu users may occasionally encounter issues with the device repeatedly disconnecting or failing to connect. This guide walks you through troubleshooting and resolving these issues.

#### **Understanding the Problem**

When connecting a device that uses the CH340 USB-to-serial converter, you might notice repeated connection and disconnection messages in the system logs. A typical scenario is as follows:

```bash
[    4.580151] usb 1-3: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[    5.218826] usb 1-3: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch341 while 'brltty' sets config #1
[    5.219562] ch341-uart ttyUSB0: ch341-uart converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
```

In this example, the CH340 device initially connects to `ttyUSB0`, but it is quickly disconnected. The culprit here is often the `brltty` service, which is intended for Braille displays but can mistakenly claim the CH340 device, causing it to disconnect.

#### **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**

##### **1. Disable `brltty` Temporarily**

Initially, you can try disabling the `brltty` service to see if it resolves the issue:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop brltty
sudo systemctl disable brltty
```

After disabling the service, disconnect and reconnect your device to see if it now stays connected. Verify by running:

```bash
dmesg | grep ttyUSB
```

##### **2. Purge `brltty` for a Permanent Fix**

If disabling `brltty` works, but you want a more permanent solution, you can remove `brltty` entirely:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge brltty
```

This command will completely remove `brltty` from your system, ensuring it no longer interferes with your USB-to-serial devices.

##### **3. Reconnect and Verify**

After purging `brltty`, reconnect your CH340 device. It should now connect to `/dev/ttyUSB0` (or similar) without interruption. You can confirm the connection by running:

```bash
dmesg | grep ttyUSB
```

Open the Arduino IDE or your preferred software and select the correct port, typically `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

##### **4. Other Considerations**

- **Check for Conflicting Processes:** Ensure no other processes are using the serial port by running `lsof /dev/ttyUSB0`.
- **Try a Different USB Port or Cable:** A faulty USB port or cable can sometimes cause connectivity issues. Test with a different port or cable to rule out hardware problems.
- **Update Your System:** Make sure your system, including the kernel and USB drivers, is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

#### **Conclusion**

Troubleshooting CH340 USB-to-serial converter issues on Ubuntu often boils down to dealing with conflicts caused by services like `brltty`. By disabling or purging `brltty`, you can ensure a stable connection for your Arduino or other serial devices.

If these steps donâ€™t resolve your issue, further investigation might be needed, such as checking for additional conflicting services or testing the hardware on a different machine. However, for most users, the steps outlined above should provide a quick and effective solution.

Feel free to reach out to the Linux community or forums if you encounter more complex issues or have specific questions about your setup. Happy coding!
